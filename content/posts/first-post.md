Hey there future potential reader. I'm [@fmbellomy](https://github.com/fmbellomy), a computer science student at the University of Texas in Arlington. I have a habit of starting projects and never seeing them through to any degree of completeness, but I do it with such frequency that it's kind of like rapid prototyping but for my brain.

As such, I've learned a decent amount about the field by now and figured I'd start this site to note down the interesting or important parts of my time at university. 

You may find parts of it useful as study materials if you wind up in any of the classes I write about here.
(I'm currently enrolled in CSE 1106 and CSE 1320 as of my first semester)
