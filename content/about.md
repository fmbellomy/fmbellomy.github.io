I'm [@fmbellomy](https://github.com/fmbellomy), and this is my personal site. Blog? Whatever.

I'm currently studying Computer Science at the University of Texas at Arlington, and I've been programing as a hobby since 2018. Most of my experience lies in Systems Programming and Game Development, but I try to keep up with as much of the field as possible. (I even made this website!)

Outside of Computer Science, I also play keys for [Black Market Garden](https://www.facebook.com/MartianOTROfficial)

This website is primarily intended to serve as a blog of general things in my life, but may also prove useful to some as a study resource for the programming courses at UTA or another university.
